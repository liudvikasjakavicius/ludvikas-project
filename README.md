Travel Agency Project - Turing College

Hello Itunu,

Thank you for your time yesterday! Your points were insightful, and it was pleasant to discuss how I can make improvements.

I already made some improvements. You can visit the website at https://jakavicius.cloud/  or view the code on GitHub at https://github.com/liudvikasjakavicius/ludvikas-project. I am having trouble with the Turing repository, so I uploaded to mine. Once you see it,let me know so I can make it private.

Here are the improvements I made to the project:

1. Consolidated all the CSS code into one file called styles.css.

2. Organized different folders for the project, including index.html, main pages, cities, contact forms, and images. This organization enhances efficiency, especially in an industry context.

3. Reduced the size of images from 44.2 MB to 5.3 MB to enhance the browsing experience.

4. Replaced the lottery idea with a form to directly gather information about the desired city by selecting it from the drop-down menu.

5. Enabled clicking (and hovering) on the two images on the home page, along with a tiny text animation inviting users to explore these popular destinations.

6. Changed the names of pages from random and lengthy identifiers to short and descriptive names, such as tokyo.html.

7. Eliminated the image displaying email address and phone number, replacing it with text containing the respective links.

8. Resolved the date issue in the form through a short JavaScript code (SetMiinDate), ensuring users cannot select a date prior to the current day.

9. Ensured no errors or warnings on all pages by validating them using https://validator.w3.org/.

As a result of these improvements, the site now features:

A home or landing page with clickable/hoverable images, a form, and a newsletter.
A Destinations Gallery with 12 images that can be hovered over, redirecting users to 12 different individual pages.
12 unique Individual Destination Pages.
A Contact Us Form Page for providing requested information.
Two Contact Form Success Pages, one for the newsletter and one for general forms.
I will keep waiting for your feedback :) Sure that with time I will be doing great things. 

Again, thanks for your time.

Best, 

Liudvikas
